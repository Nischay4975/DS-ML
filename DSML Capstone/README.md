# Launch Cost Prediction & First Stage Recovery Analysis

## Introduction

This is my Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project! In this comprehensive analysis, we look at the launch data of SpaceX

### Methodology

This project employs a comprehensive data science approach, including:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering publicly available SpaceX launch data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Uncovering patterns and trends in launch operations
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful predictors for machine learning models
- **Model Development**: Building and validating predictive models for first stage recovery
- **Visualization**: Creating compelling dashboards for stakeholder communication
