# Web Scraping #
This folder contains my attempts at web scraping with the use of some python libraries.
Yahoo Finance, a renowned site for stock market data is chosen as the target for scraping. Tools used are as follows
* Python 'requests' api => To get the raw html from the site
* Beautiful Soup => To parse the raw html into a crawlable tree structure
* Pandas, matplotlib => Widely used multipurpose libraries
